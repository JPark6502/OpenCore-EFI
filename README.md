# OpenCore-EFI

Setup:
  Intel core i3-12100F
  
  nVidia GTX 1070ti
  
  Realtek RTL 8118 NIC
  
  Realtek ALC 8xx. (They just call "High Definition" audio, couldn't find more informations, and I was too lazy to disassemble my PC to check the model number)
  
  MacOS 12.5

You should install OpenCore Legacy Patcher. SIP already disabled (0xA03) on config so you don't need to.

Contact me if you have any problems 

or 

you have slightly different setup so you're having difficulty.
